CNAME Cloaking is becoming a common solution to privacy restrictions imposed by the browsers (ITP / Safari, ETP / FireFox, Chrome dropping 3rd party cookies, etc). According to the academic paper called "[The CNAME of the Game:Large-scale Analysis of DNS-based TrackingEvasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09301)", CNAME Cloaking has the following potential risks:

* Transport Security (6.1)
* Session Fixation (6.2.1)
* Cross-Site Scripting (6.2.2)
* Information Leakage (6.3)
* Cookie Leaks (6.4)

In the Discussion (7), the authors discuss using a reverse proxy instead of CNAME Cloaking. ProxyBear.io is a reverse proxy to help with privacy restrictions while still offering privacy & security protection to the end user.
